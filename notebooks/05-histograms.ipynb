    "In general, as you might already know, a histogram is a basic method for representing a statistical distribution. As it pertains to images, a histogram is a graphical representation showing how frequently various color values occur in the image. If your project involves detecting color changes between images, histograms will prove to be very useful, and histograms are also quite handy as a preparatory step before performing thresholding."
